    <h1>Python Raspberry Pi Robots</h1>
    <p>This module is intended to be taught after the basics of computer science have been covered, as well as Python coding (as seen in comscibasics). </p>
<p>The students should now have some more confidence with computing, and the core skillset covered. However, they have been guided very closed this whole time; without this, confidence would not be built up, so don&#39;t worry!</p>
<p>This module aims to introduce the students to the world of physical computing, using a Raspberry Pi, and the GPIO Zero library. This way, students can focus less on the electronics, and more on the logic of their creations. </p>
<h3 id="1-an-introduction-to-the-rapsberry-pi">1: An introduction to the Rapsberry Pi</h3>
<p>Guaranteed some of the students will have heard of the Pi, and some may even have it. This is good news, since hopefully the students will take more <strong>initiative</strong> to the problem solving skills that they will have to practise later in the module.</p>
<p>This introduction should span at least over two lessons. It will introduce the students to what the Raspberry Pi is; what it is capable of (this is a good point to use lots of media to get everyone excited); what GPIO pins are, and how we can use them with a breadboard; as well as some safety with electronics. The safety is partly for the students themselves, but mostly to prevent broken equipment from lack of care. </p>
<h3 id="2-gpio-zero">2: GPIO Zero</h3>
<p>This is a great library supported by the Raspberry Pi foundation, that really simplies what used to be a bit fiddly (for beginners). It lets students get straight into coding logic, and removes time spent understanding different types of switches, opening pins as inputs or outputs and all the other slight inconveniences of the original RPi.GPIO library. </p>
<p>The documentation is great, as well as having official Raspberry Pi guides on getting started. The library, at the time of writing, supports:</p>
<ul>
<li>Buttons (pull-up and push-down)</li>
<li>Motion sensors (PIRs)</li>
<li>Light sensors (LDRs)</li>
<li>LEDs (including control with PWM)</li>
<li>RGB LEDs</li>
<li>Buzzers</li>
<li>Motors</li>
<li>A whole range of expansion boards</li>
<li>Robots (using generic robots, and in particular the CamJam EduKit 3)</li>
</ul>
<p>We will be producing lesson plans similar to those produced in the comscibasics, to introduce each of these components and their use with GPIO Zero. However, only the basics will be covered in the standard task sheets, with an increased amount of challenge tasks (with no code, except for the teachers!). </p>
<h5 id="side-tasks">Side tasks</h5>
<p>Accompanying each of these component tasks, will be a lesson long activity, which tests the skills learnt through the simple component tutorials, but pushes students to think about solving the problems using the computer science they learnt at the start.</p>
<p>The style that these lessons will take is not yet <em>decided</em>, as such, but they should be full of discussion, brainstorming and activities. Again, we plan to use more multimedia to show how the final outcome should look. </p>
<p><strong>Note:</strong> We are not making the students come up with the circuitry for their ideas, of course the club leaders will assist with this. </p>
<p><strong>Also note:</strong> Don&#39;t be too helpful. Ask the students questions, and get them towards the answer without being leading. This should make them feel as though they can solve the problems, and they&#39;ll persevere further the next time!</p>
<p>The lesson long activities are intentionally short for the students, so that they are encouraged to interact more, experiment and think. The teachers will of course be given a full guide to refer to, as a rough guide to how the lesson should progress. </p>
<h2 id="3-combining-skills-update-needed">3: Combining skills --update needed</h2>
<p>We promised robots, and there are robots. We will have covered robot control earlier, but simply making the robot move like the turtle in Logo does. Since all of the core skills will have been covered, as well as the physical computing components, there should be a fairly solid understanding of how we can use code and electronics to make things happen. However, this will have all been fairly separate, or clear on how to use various electronics together. </p>
