    <h1>Hello, Scratch!</h1>
    <h1 id="hello-world-">Hello, world!</h1>
<p>This is our first lesson in computer science, and we&#39;ll be exploring how a computer reads code, but also having some fun in learning how to use Scratch!</p>
<h3 id="what-is-scratch-">What is Scratch?</h3>
<p>Scratch is a web app (or <em>programming environment</em>) where we can learn how computers process code and instructionsâ€“but also make cool, visual stuff really easily. </p>
<h3 id="but-i-ve-used-scratch-">But I&#39;ve used Scratch!</h3>
<p>Don&#39;t worry! Lots of primary schools use Scratch, but some don&#39;t. We need to make sure everyone gets to grips with it, and we&#39;re only spending one lesson messing around with all the tools to get something together. </p>
<h2 id="the-task">The task</h2>
<p>We will be making our own movie in Scratch, under the title: <strong>&quot;Hello, World!&quot;</strong>. We have a template for you <a href="https://scratch.mit.edu/projects/126051692/#editor">here</a>, but you don&#39;t have to use that if you don&#39;t want to! </p>
<p>If you&#39;ve used Scratch before, great! Get started! But if not, we&#39;ll teach you all about Sprites and backgrounds and how to get the sea moving to start off with!</p>
<p>First, let&#39;s get you a Scratch account!</p>
<h3 id="signing-up-to-scratch">Signing up to Scratch</h3>
<ol>
<li>On the page we linked to above (or <a href="https://scratch.mit.edu/projects/126051692/#editor">here</a>, if you missed it), click the orange &quot;remix&quot; button. </li>
<li>A dialogue should pop up, and now click &quot;Or Join Scratch&quot;. This brings you to another screen, where you have to enter a username (be creative), and a password (make it complicated, but don&#39;t forget it). </li>
<li>Enter your birth month and year, along with your gender and country (United Kingdom). </li>
<li>Now you&#39;ll be asked to enter your email address. <strong>Use your school one</strong>. This is just because it&#39;s easy!</li>
</ol>
<p>Then you&#39;re ready to go! Congrats!</p>
<h3 id="what-are-sprites-">What are Sprites?</h3>
<p>In the bottom left hand corner of your screen you&#39;ll see some pictures with the title &quot;Sprites&quot;.</p>
